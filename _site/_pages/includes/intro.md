I am a 3rd-year CSE Ph.D. student at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk), under the supervision of [Prof. Michael R. Lyu](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/lyu/) (IEEE & ACM Fellow).

My research interests include program analysis and LLM for code. Specifically, I am devoted to improving the quality of system runtime information and utilizing system runtime behaviors for cloud incident management (Dev for Ops with LLMs). 

Previously, I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology from Huazhong University of Science and Technology in 2021.
