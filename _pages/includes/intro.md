I received my Ph.D degree at the [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk), under the supervision of [Prof. Michael R. Lyu](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/lyu/). Previously, I received Bachelor's degree in Information Security from Huazhong University of Science and Technology in 2021. 

I am dedicated to building next-generation **AI Coding Agents** by mastering the full spectrum of techs involved. My goal is to bridge the gap between SE tools and models.

My expertise is built on three core pillars:

- **Coding Agent Tools & Skills**: Developing agents grounded in **Program Analysis**, treating static and dynamic analysis as equipable skills that allow agents to be precise and verifiable.
- **Repository-Level Context Engineering**: Optimizing code context and architecture to enable agents to understand and modify large-scale, complex codebases.
- **Open Code World Model**: Pioneering **execution-aware** problem solving. Combining SFT/RL with dynamic program analysis, aiming to evolve LLMs from static text generators into agents that understand execution states.

**Feel free to drop me an email if you are interested in my research or just want to talk with me 😆.**
